                <div class="statement">Rim protection is the highest defensive priority at every level</div>
                <div class="reasoning">
                    Advanced analytics show that <span class="stats-inline">6 of top-10 teams rank top-8 in restricted area defense</span>, while only 1 of top-10 defenses ranks top-8 in three-point prevention. Interior defense creates the foundation for all other defensive success.
                </div>
                <div class="example">
                    Virginia's 2019 championship team allowed just 47.1% shooting in the restricted area (5th nationally) while allowing 33.3% from three (64th nationally). Their rim protection enabled aggressive closeouts on shooters because help was always available.

                <div class="reasoning">
                    Modern basketball's pace and spacing demands require multiple defensive concepts. Teams using rigid single systems show <span class="stats-inline">15% lower adaptation rates</span> to opponent adjustments compared to teams deploying strategic combinations.
                </div>
                <div class="example">
                    The 2020 Lakers championship run featured man-to-man base defense, zone packages against specific lineups, and press situations in crucial moments. Their defensive versatility allowed them to adjust to every opponent's strengths throughout the playoffs.

                    A high school team improving from 95 to 87 defensive rating (8-point improvement) typically sees 4-6 additional wins per season. This provides coaches with concrete evidence that defensive improvement directly correlates with team success.

                <div class="reasoning">
                    This formation forces turnovers on <span class="stats-inline">28% of possessions</span> versus 22% for 2-2-1 press, while requiring only basic athletic ability rather than exceptional length. The diamond creates multiple trapping opportunities with built-in safety coverage.
                </div>
                <div class="example">
                    A youth team struggling with a 12-point halftime deficit implements the diamond press in the third quarter. Within 6 minutes, they force 5 turnovers leading to 12 quick points, cutting the deficit to 2 points and completely changing game momentum.

                    Time pressure compounds the stress created by defensive pressure. Teams trailing by 8-15 points in final 5 minutes show <span class="stats-inline">significantly higher turnover rates</span> when facing press defense due to urgency and fatigue factors.
                </div>
                <div class="example">
                    Your team trails by 10 with 4 minutes remaining. Implementing press defense forces 3 turnovers in 90 seconds, creating 8 quick points and a realistic comeback opportunity. Without the press, you likely accept defeat and focus on "playing hard."
